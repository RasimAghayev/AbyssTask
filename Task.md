Dear Candidate,

We have reviewed your application and would like to proceed to the next stage 
of our selection process. A couple of requirements have to be met to be qualified
for this position. You must be able to communicate with ease in English, as the work
will be conducted in English, and must be an advanced user of Laravel and preferably Django.
The project we are working on is for a startup that is going to launch in a few months and is
a very complex project. We are building an online platform for developers that combines
a marketplace and a forum. The platform is about 85% ready and we are looking
for someone who can help us complete the project by the end of the year.
In order to ensure that you are of the level we require, we would like to ask you to complete the following task:

1) Create a fresh Laravel 9 project

2) Create APÄ° to save name (string, max 50), description (string, max 250),
   file (image, size max 5mb), type (should be 1, 2 or 3) inputs in mysql DB. Before saving,
   validate the whole data and save the image file in a private folder in storage.
   This api should return only name, type and description after saving data.

3) Create an API to list the whole records only with name, type and description being returned. Data should paginate by 10 at a time.

4) Create an API to show a single record with name, type, description and temporary url of image.

5) Create a cron job to delete 30 days old records each hour.

Writing clean codes and using Laravel functionalities will be a plus.

6) Create a public github repository and push your whole codes


This task is purely to test your abilities and has no direct relation to our project.
Ideally the task shouldn't take you longer than 2-3 hours however given that
you might be busy with other work we are giving you two to three days to
complete the test task and submit it via a github repo.



Good Luck,

Abyss
